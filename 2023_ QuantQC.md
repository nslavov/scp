&nbsp;

QuantQC is an R package for evaluation, benchmarking and processing of single-cell proteomics data, especially data from experiments using [nPOP](nPOP). It
can be used to map all metadata and generate quality reports for quick evaluation of
the experiment. QuantQC generates HTML reports for evaluating nPOP sample preparation, stability of
data acquisition, and quantification performance that can be easily shared with
colleagues. QuantQC also facilitates exploratory data analysis such as visualizing
agreement between peptides mapping to the same protein across clusters.

## Implementation
QuantQC is available as an R package from [github.com/SlavovLab/QuantQC](https://github.com/SlavovLab/QuantQC). Try it out and give us feedback!
