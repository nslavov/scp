# Analysis of single-cell proteomics data

&nbsp;

This section organizes computational pipelines for the analysis of single-cell proteomics data. These pipelines can be used with data generated from various [methods](methods) for single-cell proteomics.

## SCoPE2 pipeline
The [pipeline](https://github.com/SlavovLab/SCoPE2/tree/master/code) was developed to process the [SCoPE2](scope2) data from [Spech et al., 2019](Specht_et_al_2019), but with small modifications it has been used with [plexDIA](plexDIA) and [pSCoPE](pSCoPE) data as well.

## Increasing confident peptide identifications
[DART-ID](https://dart-id.slavovlab.net/) implements principled Bayesian frameworks for global retention time (RT) alignment and for incorporating RT estimates towards improved confidence estimates of peptide-spectrum-matches.

## Visualizing LC-MS/MS data
[DO-MS](https://do-ms.slavovlab.net) is an an interactive [open source](https://github.com/SlavovLab/DO-MS) platform for their interactive visualization and analysis of LC-MS/MS data: Data-driven Optimization of MS (DO-MS)
