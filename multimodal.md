&nbsp;

Single-cell multimodal analysis techniques have also opened new opportunities for analyzing biological systems, such as quantifying [post-transcriptional regulation](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005535) at single-cell resolution.

This section is devoted to methods that combine single-cell protein analysis with other omics analysis, such as single-cell RNA-seq.
