# Sample preparation for single-cell proteomics

&nbsp;

Accurate and scalable single-cell protein analysis begins with an efficient and automated single-cell [sample preparation](https://sample-prep.slavovlab.net). The pages of this section summarize methods that use solely mass-spec compatible reagents and allow parallel preparation of thousands of single cells in small volumes.
