## Introduction
The nano-ProteOmic sample Preparation (nPOP) uses piezo acoustic dispensing to isolate individual cells in 300 picoliter volumes and performs all subsequent preparation steps in small droplets on a fluorocarbon-coated slide. This design enables simultaneous sample preparation of thousands of single cells, including lysing, digesting, and labeling individual cells in volumes below 20 nl.


## Advantages of nPOP
  1. nPOP can prepare thousands of single cells in a single batch
     - This minimizes the # of batches and associated technical covariation
  2. nPOP uses only mass-spec compatible chemicals and volumes below 20 nl
     - This results in very low contamination background
  3. nPOP layout of droplets is computationally programmable and thus very flexible
     - Thus nPOP can be used for all multiplexed or label-free workflows without specialized consumables  
  4. nPOP uses accessible consumables and small amounts of labels  
     - This keeps costs down to about 10-20 cents / single cell.

A disadvantage of nPOP is that it uses an instrument, CellenONE, that while commercially available is not widely accessible.

## Abstract

Mass spectrometry methods have enabled quantifying thousands of proteins at the single cell level. These methods open the door to tackling many biological challenges, such as characterizing heterogeneity in the tumor micro-environment and better understanding signaling pathways driving stem cell differentiation. To further advance single-cell MS analysis, we developed an automated nano-ProteOmic sample Preparation (nPOP). nPOP isolates individual cells in 300 picoliter volumes and performs all subsequent preparation steps in small droplets on a hydrophobic glass slide, which allows to keep sample volumes below 15 nl.

## About the project

This project on characterizing the isobaric carrier was conducted in the [Slavov Laboratory](https://slavovlab.net) and [SCP Center](https://center.single-cell.net) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), and was authored by [Harrison Specht](http://harrisonspecht.com) and [Nikolai Slavov](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/slavov-nikolai/).
