## Introduction
The nano-ProteOmic sample Preparation (nPOP) uses piezo acoustic dispensing to isolate individual cells in 300 picoliter volumes and performs all subsequent preparation steps in small droplets on a fluorocarbon-coated slide. This design enables simultaneous sample preparation of thousands of single cells, including lysing, digesting, and labeling individual cells in volumes below 20 nl.

### Distinct aspects
  * nPOP can prepare thousands of single cells in a single batch, thus minimizing the # of batches and associated technical covariation
  * nPOP uses only mass-spec compatible chemicals and volumes below 20 nl, which results in very low contamination background
  * nPOP is very flexible and can be adopted to any multiplexed or label free workflow by simply adjusting the layout of droplets
  * pPOP uses accessible consumables and small amounts of labels, which keeps cost to down to about 10-20 cents / single cell.   



## Applications & data
  *  [Leduc et al, 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.24.441211v2) used nPOP to prepare samples for [SCopE2](scope2) analysis of the cell division cycle of U937 and Hela cells. **[Leduc et al, 2021 data website](Leduc_et_al_2021)**
  *  [Derks et al, 2022](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.03.467007v2) used nPOP to prepare samples for [plexDIA](plexDIA) analysis of single  melanoma, monocyte and pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells. **[Derks et al, 2022 data website](Derks_et_al_2022)**
  *  [Leduc et al, 2022](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.24.441211v3) used nPOP to prepare samples for [pSCopE](pscope) analysis of protein covariation in monocytes and melanoma cells. **[Leduc et al, 2022 data website](Leduc_et_al_2022)**

## Abstract

Mass spectrometry methods have enabled quantifying thousands of proteins at the single cell level. These methods open the door to tackling many biological challenges, such as characterizing heterogeneity in the tumor micro-environment and better understanding signaling pathways driving stem cell differentiation. To further advance single-cell MS analysis, we developed an automated nano-ProteOmic sample Preparation (nPOP). nPOP isolates individual cells in 300 picoliter volumes and performs all subsequent preparation steps in small droplets on a hydrophobic glass slide, which allows to keep sample volumes below 15 nl.

## About the project

This project on characterizing the isobaric carrier was conducted in the [Slavov Laboratory](https://slavovlab.net) and [SCP Center](https://center.single-cell.net) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), and was authored by [Harrison Specht](http://harrisonspecht.com) and [Nikolai Slavov](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/slavov-nikolai/). Learn more about [single-cell mass-spectrometry analysis](https://scope2.slavovlab.net/mass-spec/single-cell-proteomics).  


This project was supported by funding from the [NIH Director's Award](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9167004&icde=31336575).
