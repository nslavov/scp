## Preparing LC-MS/MS systems
The liquid chromatography system and the mass spectrometer need to be optimized for analyzing tiny protein samples to a state described here as *single-cell ready*. This preparation can be accomplished using bulk samples diluted to single-cell levels. The preparation has been described in multiple protocols, including by [Petelski *et al.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-021-00616-z), *Nature Protocols*.

Achieving *single-cell readiness* is also discussed in [workshops](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHLRxq8iKFsLJey2MshSlUhg1lGAj0dLW) of the Single Cell Proteomics Conference.

## Preparing single-cell samples
Preparing single cells for mass spectrometry protein analysis Ames to maximize protein delivery to the detectors while at the same time minimizing contaminations. These objectives are challenging, especially when we would like to prepare and analyze tens of thousands of single cells. A high-throughput sample preparation has been described by [Leduc *et al.*](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-022-02817-5), *Geneome Biology*.

## Optimizing and benchmarking LC-MS/MS analysis
Our protocols for optimizing peptide separation and tandem mass spectrometry analysis include data driven pipelines named DO-MS. These protocols and the associated software tools are available at: [do-ms.slavovlab.net](https://do-ms.slavovlab.net/). DO-MS allows to optimization of duty cycle methods, peptide separation, number of survey scans per duty cycle, and quality control of single-cell data acquisition for [DDA](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00039) and [DIA](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.3c00177) methods.
