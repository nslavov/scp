# Methods for single-cell proteomics

&nbsp;

This section organizes methods for single-cell protein analysis developed in the [Slavov Laboratory](https://slavovlab.net). The methods are organized by the year of first publication, which is often a preprint. Each method links to datasets generated by the method, which are organized in the [data](data) section of this web portal. All methods label single cells with mass tags (barcodes), which allows simultaneous analysis of multiple cells in parallel. This facilitates [scaling up](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947621001511?via%3Dihub) and reducing the cost per single cell.

## Shotgun single-cell proteomics
[SCoPE-MS](SCoPE-MS) and its second version [SCoPE2](SCoPE2) can analyze thousands of proteins selected in order of their abundance in the samples.

&nbsp;

## Prioritized single-cell proteomics
[pSCoPE](pSCoPE) can analyze thousands of proteins selected in order of their priority for the biological questions and projects of interest.


&nbsp;


## Parallel analysis of both single cells and peptides
[plexDIA](plexDIA) quantifies about a thousand proteins per single cell while parallelizing the analysis of both single cells and peptides. It does not use a carrier sample.
