# Methods for single-cell proteomics

&nbsp;

This section organizes mass spectrometry methods for single-cell protein analysis developed in the [Slavov Laboratory](https://slavovlab.net). The methods are organized by the year of first publication. Each method links to datasets generated by the method, which are organized in the [data](data) section of this web portal. All methods label single cells with mass tags (barcodes), which allows simultaneous analysis of multiple cells in parallel and thus facilitates [scaling up](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcpro.2021.100179) throughput and reducing the cost per single cell.

## Shotgun single-cell proteomics
[SCoPE-MS](SCoPE-MS) and its second version [SCoPE2](SCoPE2) can analyze thousands of proteins selected in order of their abundance in the samples.

&nbsp;

## Prioritized single-cell proteomics
[pSCoPE](pSCoPE) can analyze thousands of proteins selected in order of their priority for the [biological](biology) questions and projects of interest.


&nbsp;


## Parallel analysis of both single cells and peptides
[plexDIA](plexDIA) can quantify thousands of proteins per single cell while parallelizing the analysis of both single cells and peptides. [Isotopologous carriers](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.2c00721) can further increase the depth of proteome analysis.
