# Single-cell proteomic datasets


&nbsp;

This section organizes single-cell proteomics data repositories for projects from the [Slavov Laboratory](https://slavovlab.net). The projects are organized by the corresponding publications denoted by the first author and year of first publication as a preprint.

Each dataset webpage links to the corresponding technology used for protein analysis, which is described in the [methods](methods) section of this website.

The datasets are reported in accordance with the [Community Guidelines](https://single-cell.net/guidelines) published in *Nat Methods* **20**, 375â€“386 (2023).
